# Testing with RSpec
This repository contains my solutions and notes for the Testing Course with RSpec. During this course, I learned how to write effective tests for Ruby applications using RSpec. Here's a brief overview of what I covered:

- Introduction to software testing and RSpec
- Setting up RSpec in a Ruby project
- Writing basic tests with RSpec syntax
- Using RSpec's built-in matchers for assertions
- Organizing tests with describe and context blocks
- Running tests and interpreting results
